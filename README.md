<h1>File Permissions in Linux</h1>

<h2> Project Description</h2>
The file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory need to be updated. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep the system secure. 
<br />


<h2>Program steps </h2>
To complete this task, I performed the following tasks:

- <b>Check file and directory details</b> 
- <b>Describe the permissions string</b>
- <b>Change file permissions</b> 
- <b>Change file permissions on a hidden file</b>
- <b>Change directory permissions</b>


<h2>Summary of the project </h2>

The first step in this was using ls -la to check the permissions for the directory. This informed my decisions in the following steps. I then used the chmod command multiple times to change the permissions on files and directories.
